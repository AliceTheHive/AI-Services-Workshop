# Setup
In this lab you'll get your machine setup with all the software, samples and services you'll need to fully participate in the other labs during the workshop.

## 1 - Install Visual Studio Code
You'll need a text editor to follow the other labs. We strongly recommend Visual Studio Code; this is what all the demos and labs will use, but if you already have something else installed which you'd prefer to use, feel free to skip this step.

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
1. Download and install the appropriate version for your machine (Windows, Mac or Linux)

## 2 - Install GitHub Desktop
You'll need a GitHub client to clone the repository containing the labs. We strongly recommend GitHub Desktop but if you already have another GitHub compatible client installed, feel free to skip this step.

1. Go to https://desktop.github.com/
1. Download and install the appropriate version for your machine (Windows, Mac or Linux)

## 3 - Clone the 'AI Services Workshop' GitHub repo
All of the labs, samples and instructions are contained in a GitHub repository. You need to ['clone'](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to get a local copy to work from.

1. Go to https://github.com/martinkearn/AI-Services-Workshop
1. Click 'Clone or download'
1. Click 'Open in desktop'
1. Accept any operating system prompts to open the link in GitHub Desktop
1. Choose or accept the default local location for the cloned repository
1. Make you you do a 'sync' or 'pull' (not 'pull request') of the latest commit to the master branch

## 4 - Get an Azure subscription
You'll need an Azure subscription to host various services that are created during the day. If you already have an Azure subscription, you can use that and skip this step (the costs for all the labs today is small).

If you don't already have Azure (or want your own subscription just for today), you can get a creditcard-free trial by following these steps.

We have limited numbers of trial codes and so you should only claim one if you need one. You can also sign-up for a trial using https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/, this gives you Â£150 credit but requires credit card details for verification purposes.

If you don't have an existing subscription and are not willing to use your credit card as a security verification, please go ahead.

1. Go to http://aka.ms/AzurePassManager
1. Enter 'AIEvent' as an event name
1. Click 'Find event'
1. Click 'Claim your code'
1. Make a note of the code that you are given (you'll only see this once)
1. Go to https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/
1. Sign in with a 'Microsoft account' (i.e. Outlook.com, Hotmail.co.uk, Live.co.uk etc .....cannot be a school or organisation account)
1. Enter the promo code obtained in the previous section and click 'Claim promo code'
