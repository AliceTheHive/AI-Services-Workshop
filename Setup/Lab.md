# Setup
In this lab you'll get your machine setup with all the software, samples and services you'll need to fully participate in the other labs during the workshop.

## Part 1 - Install Visual Studio Code
You'll need a text editor to follow the other labs. We strongly recommend Visual Studio Code; this is what all the demos and labs will use, but if you already have something else installed which you'd prefer to use, feel free to skip this step.

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
1. Download and install the appropriate version for your machine (Windows, Mac or Linux)

## Part 2 - Install GitHub Desktop
You'll need a GitHub client to clone the repository containing the labs. We strongly recommend GitHub Desktop but if you already have another GitHub compatible client installed, feel free to skip this step.

1. Go to https://desktop.github.com/
1. Download and install the appropriate version for your machine (Windows, Mac or Linux)

## Part 3 - Clone the 'AI Services Workshop' GitHub repo
All of the labs, samples and instructions are contained in a GitHub repository. You need to ['clone'](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to get a local copy to work from.

1. Go to https://github.com/martinkearn/AI-Services-Workshop
1. Click 'Clone or download'
1. Click 'Open in desktop'
1. Accept any operating system prompts to open the link in GitHub Desktop
1. Choose or accept the default local location for the cloned repository
1. Make you you do a 'sync' or 'pull' (not 'pull request') of the latest commit to the master branch

## Part 4 - Get an Azure subscription
