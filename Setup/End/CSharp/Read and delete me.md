This folder is where the C# lab's ending files will be placed. This should be the files and folders that would have been created after completion of the lab.

If there are no end files, simple created a Readme.md file which states "There are no end files for this lab".

Once you have populated this folder, this file can be deleted as it is only for authoring guidance.
